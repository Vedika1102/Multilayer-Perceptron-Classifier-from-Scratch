# Multilayer-Perceptron-Classifier-from-Scratch

This Python code provides a basic implementation of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier from scratch. It supports customizable neural network configurations, training with gradient descent, and cross-entropy loss monitoring. Users can train the model and make predictions for classification tasks. However, it is primarily intended for educational purposes, and for production or complex tasks, established deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch are recommended.
